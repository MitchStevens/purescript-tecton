============

CSS is a large, complex language whose syntax relies heavily on its dynamically-typed nature. Consequently, building a statically-typed interface with reasonable accuracy and precision is a challenging proposition, the work of which will (probably) never be complete. Fortunately, a large subset of the language may suffice for most use cases; and, with your help, we can deliver and maintain that for the PureScript community. Listed below are a few ways you can contribute.

Reporting defects

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/nsaunders/purescript-tecton/issues/new) in the GitHub repository to discuss any defects you find. In addition to a brief description, include
* the code you wrote;
* the expected output;
* the compiler error or incorrect output you encountered; and
* if possible, a link to the relevant W3C specification, which can find [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2021/) or via Google search.
