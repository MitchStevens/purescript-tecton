Contributing
============

Welcome, and thanks for your interest in Tecton. Whether you are new to CSS and PureScript or are here to teach us some new tricks, we're glad that you're here and look forward to your contributions. Listed below are a few of the ways you can help.

Asking questions
----------------
If you have a question, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nsaunders/purescript-tecton/issues/new) to discuss it. This might help us to find a defect or an opportunity to improve the documentation or developer experience; or it could help someone facing the same issue in the future.

Reporting defects
-----------------
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/nsaunders/purescript-tecton/issues/new) to discuss any defects you find. In addition to a brief description, include
* the code you wrote;
* the expected output;
* the compiler error or incorrect output you encountered; and
* if possible, a link to the relevant W3C specification, which can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2021/) or via Google search.

Improving documentation
-----------------------
Please share any suggestions for improving or adding to the documentation by [submitting pull request](https://github.com/nsaunders/purescript-tecton/compare) or [opening an issue](https://github.com/nsaunders/purescript-tecton/issues/new).

Sharing resources
-----------------
If you have created a tutorial, related library, interesting code example, or other resource related to Tecton, please [share it with the PureScript community](https://discourse.purescript.org). Increasing awareness will bring more users (and potential contributors) to the project.

Submitting code
---------------
Pull requests are welcome, but we ask that you [open an issue](https://github.com/nsaunders/purescript-tecton/issues/new) to discuss your plans before making any significant investment of your valuable time.

### Development environment

You can use [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) to create a development environment with all of the required tooling. Simply run `nix-shell` in the root project directory, and you'll have everything you need to get started.

You will also need to run `npm install` to obtain additional dependencies required to verify your changes before you are ready to submit them.
