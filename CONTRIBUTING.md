============

CSS is a large, complex language whose syntax takes full advantage of its dynamically-typed nature. Delivering reasonable accuracy, precision, and developer experience in a statically-typed interface is a challenging proposition. We can only hope to cover a large enough subset of CSS to satisfy the majority of real-world use cases. But with your help, we can continue to increase our footprint while maintaining a production-level standard of quality. Listed below are a few ways you can contribute.
