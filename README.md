# Tecton

[![CI](https://github.com/nsaunders/purescript-tecton/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/nsaunders/purescript-tecton/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)

Tecton provides a type-safe interface to CSS that guards against a variety of [errors](examples/TypeSafety.purs) while delivering much of the flexibility and authoring experience of using CSS directly. As an embedded domain-specific language, Tecton builds upon the excellent capabilities of [PureScript](https://purescript.org).

## Installation

The preferred installation method is [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago).

```sh
spago install tecton
```
